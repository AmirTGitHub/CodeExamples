# Complete authentication app with MERN stack
This is part of an app but I taught that would be helpful to make it separately available as an stand alone app.
# How to run the App
Inside the `api` folder run `yarn dev` this will trigger the api also wil be run the `React` app to.
# Technologies that I have used for backend
I used `Express` for the server and routing and `MongoDB` for a database. You need to change the `DATABASE` inthe `variable.env` file and it should be look like this:
```DATABASE=mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds119702.mlab.com:19702/<dbNameCollection>```.And everything all run on the `NodeJS`.
# Technologies that I have used for frontend
I used `React` and `Redux` to run the frontend and `Bootstrap` for styling the app.
